** Links

Internal Links follow the [[Wiki]] [[Wiki][Wiki Wiki]] style, also WikiWords work.

To recap:

[[Wiki]] is `[[Wiki]]`
[[Wiki][Wiki]] is `[[Wiki][Wiki]]`
WikiWords was `WikiWords`

You can easily plug into the handling of links and implement things like `[[flash:screencast-blog][My Screencast about Blogging]]`, but by default there will be no link formatting until I can find a nice set of defaults.

** Lists

 * Lists start with a `*` after one or more spaces from the beginning of a line.
   * Nested lists are maybe not working correctly yet.

** Headers

Headers are written as follows:

{{{
* h1
** h2
*** h3
**** h4
***** h5
****** h6
}}}

** Code

You can start a code block with `{{{` and end it with `}}}`, each on its own line. For code inside a line please use =`backticks`=.

{{{
This is a line of code
}}}


{{{ ruby
puts "This is a line of Ruby code"
}}}

You may also use `c`, `delphi`, `html`, `ezamar`, `nitro_xhtml`, `plaintext`, `rhtml`, or `xml`

** Text formatting

/italic/ is `/italic/`
*bold* is `*bold*`
_underline_ is `_underline_`
+strikethrough+ is `+strikethrough+`
~blockquote~ is `~blockquote~`
=code= is `=code=`
and `code` is =`code`=
last, but not least, there's also `----` the horizontal rule
